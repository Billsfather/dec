总的来说，BFGS 在一些函数计算成本较高的场景中，每次迭代计算量大可能会拖慢训练速度。虽然它在迭代次数上更少且最终损失更小，但对于视觉识别这样需要频繁全批次计算的任务，SGD 或 mini-batch 优化方法通常能更高效地平衡计算时间和性能。

# Self-Introduction

Hello, professors. My name is Wang Haoyu. I graduated from the School of Science at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, where I not only excelled academically but also actively participated in various outdoor volunteer activities. These experiences have taught me the value of teamwork and community service, shaping my character and broadening my perspective.

During my undergraduate studies in Applied Physics, I developed a solid foundation in the theory of communication and system science. My graduation project focused on optimizing deep neural networks using variational methods. In particular, I explored the L-BFGS optimization method, which offers a more stable approach than SGD by reducing random gradient noise and mitigating oscillations caused by large step sizes. This research further deepened my understanding of artificial intelligence applications.

I am proficient in Python and MATLAB, particularly in data analysis. For instance, in a course project, I applied MATLAB to construct and process communication signals using convolution. Additionally, I am skilled in data analysis tools like Origin and have experience with Material Studio for crystal structure modeling. My English proficiency is at the CET-6 level, with strong listening and speaking abilities.

Beyond academics, I have a strong passion for AI and its applications in medical image analysis and processing. By pursuing graduate studies, I aim to deepen my expertise in this field and contribute innovative research achievements. I look forward to the opportunity to learn from esteemed professors and collaborate on impactful research projects. Thank you.
