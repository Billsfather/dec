Self-Introduction
Hello, professors. My name is Wang Haoyu. I am a calm and composed individual who gets along well with others. I have a strong desire for self-improvement and am highly motivated in learning. I approach tasks with diligence, responsibility, and a strong sense of teamwork. I have a proactive mindset and a broad perspective, allowing me to endure hardships and remain curious about new things.
  During my undergraduate studies in Applied Physics at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, I gained a solid foundation in subjects such as quantum mechanics, electromagnetism, optics, and signal processing. My graduation project focused on the optimization of deep neural networks using variational methods, which strengthened my understanding of artificial intelligence applications.
I am proficient in Python and MATLAB for programming, and I am skilled in using office software such as Word, Excel, and PPT, as well as data analysis tools like Origin. Additionally, I have experience with Material Studio for crystal structure modeling. My English proficiency is at CET-6 level, with strong listening and speaking abilities.
I have a keen interest in AI and its applications in information networks. Through graduate studies, I hope to deepen my knowledge, enhance my research capabilities, and contribute to this field. Thank you!å“¦
