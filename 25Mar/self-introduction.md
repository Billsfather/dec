总的来说，BFGS 在一些函数计算成本较高的场景中，每次迭代计算量大可能会拖慢训练速度。虽然它在迭代次数上更少且最终损失更小，但对于视觉识别这样需要频繁全批次计算的任务，SGD 或 mini-batch 优化方法通常能更高效地平衡计算时间和性能。

Hello, professors. My name is Wang Haoyu.I graduated from the School of Science at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.
 During my undergraduate studies in Applied Physics , I developed a strong foundation in theroy of communication and system science. My graduation project focused on optimizing deep neural networks using variational methods. In particular, I explored the L-BFGS optimization method, which offers a more stable approach than SGD by reducing random gradient noise and mitigating oscillations caused by large step sizes. This research further deepened my understanding of artificial intelligence applications.

I am proficient in Python and MATLAB, particularly in data analysis. I have applied MATLAB to construct and process communication signals using convolution in a course project. Additionally, I am skilled in data analysis tools like Origin and have experience with Material Studio for crystal structure modeling. My English proficiency is at the CET-6 level, with strong listening and speaking abilities.

I have a strong passion for AI and its applications in medical image analysis and processing. By pursing graduate studies, I aim to deepen my expertise in this field and contribute innovative research achievement. I look forward to the opportunity to learn from professors and collaborate on impactful research projects. Thank you
